# Podman Practice Repository

This repository is dedicated to practicing and exploring **Podman**, the container engine.  
It is organized into multiple subdirectories, each representing a different task, topic, or lab related to Podman.

Each subdirectory contains its own `README.md` file with relevant instructions, explanations, and usage examples specific to that topic.

Feel free to explore the subfolders to learn and experiment with various Podman concepts.
